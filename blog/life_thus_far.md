At the moment of writing this I am 27 years old, soon to be 28 on January 11th. 
Life has certainly not been a straight path and I am only just beginnign to realize
my potential. While I was in high school and for most of college I was always following
a path a 'least resistance'. As a result I wasn't a great independent thinker and 
usually did something because I was told to do so. When I was told to go to college 
I simply accepted that it was something society required of us. I mean of course I
understand that without an education you won't be able to compete in this high-tech economy. 
However I suppose it wasn't really spelled out to me what field I should be going to 
college for. Thus I did what my brother and sister did, I persued and compeleted a degree 
in Biology.

Now I wouldn't say that it was a waste of my time but it didn't leave me with a lot
of choices straight out of school. Either you went into research as a molecular
biologist or you joined the medical career. I considered both paths by joining a
lab for two years of my undergrad and being a medical scribe in the emergercy room.
I absolutely hated being in the ER because I was bombarded by a constant stream of 
sadness. Witnessing how a family dealt with the aftermath of their loved on experiencing
a stroke was heart-wrenching. I wanted to comfort the family but all I could do was 
quietly cry and quickly take notes because we only had 5 - 10 mins with each patient.

Research on the other hand was a lot of fun but I decided against it because I wasn't
able to get into the best schools with my grades. I am actually very glad that I 
didn't have the best grades because I would have certainly joined a lab at 22. 
As a result of the lack of options I was forced to actually reevaluate my goals in life
and consider the meaning of my existance. Thus after a lot of thought and a lot of going
back and forth I landed upon obtaining a Masters in Bioinformatics.
