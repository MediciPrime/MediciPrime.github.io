<p>Bioinformatician by day and space enthusiast by night!! I received a Masters in Bioinformatics from Johns Hopkins and I continued my training as a Bioinformatician at the NIH. However before stepping foot into the world of a data scientists I was fortunate enough to have majored in Genetics/Biology. During my time as a undergrad I always enjoyned learning about genetics but I was not too fond of running wet lab experiments. Routine experiments would sometimes fail for unknown reasons making it so that one would need to perform multiple time consuming replicates in order to establish a mean. </p>
