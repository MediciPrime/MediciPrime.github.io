<p>I am a Bioinformatician by training.  Over the years my employers have noted my ability to be well organized
and steadfast with completing any bioinformatics task.  I pride myself on being able to learn new
concepts with limited intervention, as shown in the list of examples highlighted below.</p>

<h2>Self-Taught Topics</h2>

<ul class="self-taught">
    <li>Completed Distance Learning Bioinformatics Masters Degree from JHU</li>
    <li>Implemented Snakemake Workflows</li>
    <li>Setup Flask-Based Full Stack Data Presentation Websites</li>
    <li>Analyzed ALL Types of Bioinformatics Data</li>
    <li>Self-Taught High Level Math Courses (Calculus 3, Linear Algebra)</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, I am teaching myself Probability Theory and Lisp/Julia in order to apply for a Biostatistics PhD program. 
As a result I have pivoted from full-time employment to contract work where I complete occasional analysis for research
labs at the NIH.  I have set this as my goal because my current statistical knowledge has constrained my ability to 
understand the limitation of various bioinformatics tools.  This limitation can only be addressed after I am able to
comprehend what statistical models these bioinformatics tools are dependent upon.  Also I aim to create my own bioinformatics 
tools to better fit the underlying assumptions of the data being analyzed.</p>
