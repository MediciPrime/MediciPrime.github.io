<p>Bioinformatician by day and space enthusiast by night!! I received a Masters in Bioinformatics from Johns Hopkins and I continued my training as a Bioinformatician at the NIH. However before stepping foot into the world of a data scientist I was fortunate enough to have majored in Genetics/Biology. During undergrad I mainly worked as a 'lab rat' by either running wet lab experiments such as PCR, cell culture or maintaining a mouse colony. At first it was all very exciting but over time I grew jaded with the occasional faliure of routine experiments or the consistent descruction of 'in valid' mice. Although it all seemed extremely wasteful was willing to accept the status quo if the end product, the data, was useful. However most times this wasn't even the case since the nature of research requires you to probe the unknown making it uncooparative. As such I decided to become a data scientist since I would then be able to analyze other people's data and not have to waste too many resources collecting my own.</p>
