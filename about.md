<p>Bioinformatician by day and space enthusiast by night!! I received a Masters in Bioinformatics from Johns Hopkins and I continued my training as a Bioinformatician at the NIH. However before stepping foot into the world of a data scientist I was fortunate enough to have majored in Biology. During my undergrauate years I mainly worked as a 'lab rat' by either running wet lab experiments such as PCR, cell culture or maintaining a mouse colony. At first it was all very exciting but over time I grew jaded with the occasional faliure of routine experiments or the consistent descruction of 'invalid' mice. Although it all seemed extremely wasteful I was willing to accept the status quo if the end product, the data, was useful. However, most times this wasn't even the case since the nature of research requires you to probe the unknown making it inherently difficult. As such I decided to become a data scientist since I would then be able to spend my time moving forward by digging into valuable unexplored data that has already been collected.</p>

<p>I am a huge proponent of democratizing data analysis so that biologists can analyze their own data without having to rely on bioinformaticians. This is because a lot of times NGS data requires the combined use of sophisticated algorithms that may not always behave with each other. A few ways I have started doing this is by creating easy to use analysis pipeline and web applications that provide biologists with a means of exploring their own HTS data. Even though this may not seem beneficial for the future of my career, I know that it will speed up discovery and eventually the advent of mainstream personalized medicine.</p>

<p>Lastly, you may be wondering why the web site is called 'Mars on my mind'. Well it's because bioinformatics can directly influence the exploration and colonization of planetary bodies. This is because while in space we will accumulate a lot of genetic mutations resulting in the early onset of cancer and death. Personalized medicine and bioinformatics can help prevent this by providing doctors with the ability to access and potentially even fix genetic mutations (#crispr). If this is not done, many brave and intelligent colonists / scientists will perish resulting in the loss of a lot of wasted potential. Thus, before we can freely explore our solar system we will need to figure out a way to fix the genetic mutations that a person accumulates.</p>
