# The Future of DNA Sequencing

I awoke this morning to find this awesome [article](https://www.nature.com/news/the-future-of-dna-sequencing-1.22787) on the commentary section of Nature's website. The article asked three prominent scientists in genetics about the future of DNA sequencing. Although they mentioned that it's very difficult to *predict* such things, they did talk about a few very exciting things. 

So sequencing is already becoming a lot cheaper but it still hasen't gotten to the point where the masses can gain access. Once it gets to the point where the cost of whole exome sequencing is <$100...
