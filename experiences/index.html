      <h1>Experiences</h1>	
	<p>
	  I have only recently entered the world of a Bioinformatician and I still have
	  A LOT left to learn.  However getting here hasn't been easy because I have made
	  it a point to take the road less traveled.  Now don't get me wrong, I don't
	  consider myself as being superior to those who have choosen to follow the 'crowd'.
	  I dislike being the center of attention and I haven't gone down this path because
	  I wanted to be <em>unique</em>.  I have already accepted the fact that as a male I have
	  I have more of a chance at being a direct decendent of Genghis Khan than being
	  <em>unique</em>.
	  <br>
	  You maybe asking yourself how?  Well it's because as a male I share at least
	  99.5% of my DNA with other males.  Now every male human has a 0.05% chance of
	  being a direct decendent of Genghis Khan, so I likely have more	of a chance
	  at being a Mongal than being <em>unique</em>.
